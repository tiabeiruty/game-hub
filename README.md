Using RAWG's API, I recreated their website. I included some features like searching; filtering by genre, platform and relevance (order by); using emojis to represent scores; ratings which have a colored box according to their score; dealing with game cards that have no images; dark and light mode; infinite scroll; caching; state management with Zustand; etc. [Chakra UI, React Query, Zustand]
